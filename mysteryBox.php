        * getRandomWeightedElement()
         * Utility function for getting random values with weighting.
         * Pass in an associative array, such as array('A'=>5, 'B'=>45, 'C'=>50)
         * An array like this means that "A" has a 5% chance of being selected, "B" 45%, and "C" 50%.
         * The return value is the array key, A, B, or C in this case.  Note that the values assigned
         * do not have to be percentages.  The values are simply relative to each other.  If one value
         * weight was 2, and the other weight of 1, the value with the weight of 2 has about a 66%
         * chance of being selected.  Also note that weights should be integers.
